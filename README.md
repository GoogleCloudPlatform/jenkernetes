# Jenkernetes

This repository provides the resources and instuctions for running a Jenkins server and individual Jenkins slaves on a Kubernetes Cluster. It also provides a plugin that allows you to administer the Kubernetes Cluster from within Jenkins workflow scripts, (and WIP administering the Kubernetes Cluster from within the Jenkins Webserver)

First checkout the [webserver and cluster setup instructions](setup/master/) then head over to the [slave creation instructions](setup/slave)

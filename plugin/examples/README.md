# Groovy Scripts

Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md) on Jenkins workflow scripts.

To run these examples, create a new "Workflow" job in Jenkins, and copy-paste the groovy in to the "Groovy CPS DSL" or put the groovy file in your SCM and select "Groovy DSL from SCM" from the dropdown. Then execute your build.
